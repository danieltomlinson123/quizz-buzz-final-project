Quizz Buzz is an app for sending out quiz questions in an interactice and spontaneous way. I can be used alongside any group activities in classrooms, workshops, conferences or for fun with friends and family. It has been designed to focus on providing users with the opportunity to both send previously-created questions, and also create questions and make any necessary edits during quiz time. The user has access to a whole community of public questions and those who join a game that has been set up don't need to log in or sign up, so no time is wasted.

In future versions more options for question types and competetive aspects such as betting and points and leaderboards will be added. The Quizz Buzz app a great opportunity fopr those using textbooks and paper to make activities more interactive. Further development to the user's site might include tools to help prepare a wider variety of educational resources that can be shared amongst the community, printed for use in workshops, classrooms and conferences, and used with the Quizz Buzz game feautures.

### Flows

### UI design (wireframes)

Below is the initial Figma flow that inspired the project. This flow shows the quiz game interaction for written response questions. Since this flow was designed functionality such as the multiple-choice question, access to a user community with favourites, ability to retrieve questions in-game, and the ability to edit and save public questions has been added.
